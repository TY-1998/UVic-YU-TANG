kosmos-mcv.c:

kosmos-mcv.c can be compiled using the gcc command in the makefile: PASS

./kosmos-mcv.c 60 60 is executed:

Program runs without crashing: PASS
Program creates at least one valid radical: PASS
Program creates several valid radicals: PASS
Program creates all or nearly all valid radicals: FAIL

Code is well written and commented: FAIL
Code uses mutexes and condition variables properly: FAIL

This program is well commented, but has many unusual problems with its organization
and operation.  No condition variables are used, and much of its regular logic is
hidden by an #IFDEF flag.  It uses random number generation extensively to imitate
proper concurrency usage, and has incorrect output (several carbons appear in multiple
radicals, and many radicals are themselves misnumbered.)

Grade for kosmos-mcv.c: C

kosmos-sem.c can be compiled using the gcc command in the makefile: PASS

./kosmos-sem.c 60 60 is executed:

Program runs without crashing: PASS
Program creates at least one valid radical: PASS
Program creates several valid radicals: PASS
Program creates all or nearly all valid radicals: PASS

Code is well written and commented: PASS
Code uses semaphores properly: PASS

This program is much better, but still has the #IFDEF guard problem.

Grade for kosmos-sem.c: A

Combined grade: B
