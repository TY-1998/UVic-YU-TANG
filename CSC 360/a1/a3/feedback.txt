In your tests directory you will find the input files we used, the expected output for each test,
and your output for each test.  Use diff -y to examine the expected and actual output side-by-side.
For example, if you lost marks for test3, `diff -y test3_expected_output.txt test3_actual_output.txt`
will show you where your output differs from the expected output.
